CLASSROOM NOTES
	Each time you have Koski you should write down any and all relevant
	notes in the day's corresponding Cornell Notes sheet. You are not
	required to fill all the space but you are encouraged to take as
	much space as you seem fit (try to take lots of notes, it helps;
	I promise). If you need more space to write your notes, you may use
	the back of the sheet or even staple on another sheet to the back
	of the first (remember that the first sheet of notes for a day MUST
	have the appropriate header).
	
	For the first page of classroom notes of every week, you must put
	the words "OH YEAH!" on the top of the page. The purpose of an
	"OH YEAH!" page is to provide a space in which you can write your
	'oh, yeah' moments (when you didn't understand something and then,
	all of a sudden, you do).  You MUST write the words "OH YEAH!" on
	top of the appropriate note pages, but you are not penalized for
	not writing down your 'oh, yeah' moments.
	
	You are not required but if you'd like you can write the topics of
	each day of classroom notes on the top of the note and in the
	corresponding entry in the table of contents (not required, but can
	it easier to find stuff).
