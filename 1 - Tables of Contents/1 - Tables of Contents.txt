 * REFER TO EACH SECTION FOR A SAMPLE OF EACH TABLE OF CONTENTS * 

TABLES OF CONTENTS
	Each table of contents (TOC) is supposed to be an directory for each
	section of your binder and provide information on the documents
	stored in each section. For example, the TOC for the Tests, Quizzes,
	& Classwork section is supposed to give an index, the date received,
	the grade, the weight, and a description of each document in the
	section.
