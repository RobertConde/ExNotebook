 * REFER TO SAMPLE * 

JOURNALS
	An page of journal should be completed for every day you have Koski
	(if you have Koski for multiple periods, you only need to complete
	one set of journals). You MUST NOT LEAVE ANY WHITESPACE except the
	line with your name in it (refer to sample). Leaving whitespace
	WILL result in a lower grade.
